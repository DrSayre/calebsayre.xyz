## What is this?
I am not really sure what this is, other than it will be a collection of things I think are neat, insteresting, or cool.  I suspect most posts will be a tutorial on how to do something in Rails or another framework, but there could be an occasional post about the latest fast food craze or a Top Ten list of my favorite Seinfeld episodes.

## How often will I post?
I have no idea.

## How is this different from Live Journal in 2003?
Hmmm... Good question...
