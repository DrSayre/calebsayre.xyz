Currently I am a Ruby Developer for Suran Systems (a Church Management System company located in Central Kentucky).  I enjoy learning new things with Rails and other web technologies.  Some of my other interests is good TV Shows, the McRib Sandwich, Cleveland Browns, University of Kentucky, Jesus, and depending on how this blog goes, I may write about all of these at some point.
